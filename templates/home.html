            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Academic achievements are scattered everywhere — certificates in folders, emails buried in inboxes, paper records collecting dust. Students struggle to showcase their accomplishments during placements or applications. Teachers waste time managing spreadsheets and physical documents. Nobody has a clear, organized view of what students have actually achieved.</p>
                <p>Our Achievement Management System centralizes everything. Students see all their achievements in one dashboard with analytics. Teachers input achievements through simple forms with auto-complete. The system tracks hackathons, coding competitions, paper presentations, conferences, and symposiums — complete with certificates, dates, positions, and detailed descriptions. Clean, fast, and organized.</p>
